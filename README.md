# About the project
In this project I made a react app, which simulates the so called gallows game.<br/>
You have 5 chances to make a mistake. After all mistakes the appropriate image will appear<br/>
If you select the right letter, the letter button will be green, and the word will be completed with it<br/>
If you find all letters, without making 5 more than 5 mistakes, you will win.
Good luck! :)
